I ran some simple tests to see how the algorithm worked on small strings, you can run those in test_dna.py

I also ran some tests with larger strings, to find the maximum size the algorithm would work on my machine.
I found that somewhere in the 20000-30000 range my machine ran out of memory(8 gbs). The algorithm
would have to be modifed to run at larger sizes, but it works for our purposes where the strings are around
16000-17000 characters long.

I ran all three studies - and the resulting alignments are stored in the dna_alignments directory.
For the pairwise studies(study 2 : 10 humans, and study 3: greate apes), I created tables comparing
their differences in a readable manner stored in the tables directory.

For the second study, it seems like the South African sample is the most different from the rest, followed
by the Navajo sample. The israel and american samples tended to have higher similarities with the other
samples.

For the third study, it seems like humans are most closely related to bonobos and chimpanzees. Gorillas
are close behind, while baboons are quite a bit farther removed from the prototypical human.
