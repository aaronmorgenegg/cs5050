According to the results graph, the backtrack algorithms performed
nearly identical to each other, while the hill climb algorithms
performed nearly identical to each other. However, overall the
hill climb algorithms outperformed the backtrack algorithms.

In the att48, dantzig42, and gr17 problem sets, all of the 
algorithms reached the same degree of accuracy. However, 
the hill climb algorithms reached a better degree of accuracy 
for the p01 and fri26 problem sets. Given these results, I 
would conclude that either one of the hill climb algorithms
would be the best choice to solve a TSP problem.
